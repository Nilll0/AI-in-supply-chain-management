# üì¶ Supply Chain Analytics with Python

This project is designed to teach you the **fundamentals of Machine Learning for Supply Chain Management** using Python. It contains example code and exercise solutions featured in the Palgrave Macmillan book:  
**[Supply Chain Analytics: Concepts, Techniques, and Applications](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-92224-5#toc)**.  
Also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/3030922235).

## üöÄ **Key Learning Objectives**

- Master Python for supply chain applications
- Learn data manipulation, visualization, and analysis techniques
- Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world supply chain problems
- Optimize logistics, inventory, and pricing strategies
- Develop forecasting models with time series analysis
